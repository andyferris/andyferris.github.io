I&amp;rsquo;m Andy Ferris, a software developer living in Brisbane, Australia.
My technical passions range from data science, data engineering and software design through to maths, physics, and information theory. These days I work at a start-up where we are building a platform to optimize businesses, and I face a wide range of challenges where I can extend and apply my skills. Previously I worked within a team of talented cloud engineers and researchers on a system to process petabytes of geospatial data, extracting features and detecting issues in power distribution networks worldwide.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.andyferris.au/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyferris.au/projects/</guid><description> Projects Link to heading I have authored and am involved a number of open source projects, mainly contributing to the Julia library ecosystem.
