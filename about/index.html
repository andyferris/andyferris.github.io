<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Andy Ferris, a software developer living in Brisbane, Australia.</p><p>My technical passions range from data science, data engineering and software design through to maths, physics, and information theory. These days I work at a <a href=https://elaraai.com>start-up</a> where we are building a platform to optimize businesses, and I face a wide range of challenges where I can extend and apply my skills. Previously I <a href=https://www.fugro.com/our-services/asset-integrity/roames-power>worked</a> within a team of talented cloud engineers and researchers on a system to process petabytes of geospatial data, extracting features and detecting issues in power distribution networks worldwide. Prior to that I was a researcher in theoretical/computational quantum physics and quantum information theory, which was a lot of fun.</p><p>As you can see, I like computers and math and love learning new things! I also enjoy teaching, and am currently helping teach <a href=https://courses.smp.uq.edu.au/MATH2504>a course</a> at the University of Queensland. I am also married to a <em>lovely</em> teacher, and we have three children which were the best products of my three postdoctoral appointments. Fun fact — they were born on <a href=https://uq.edu.au>three</a> <a href=https://www.usherbrooke.ca/>different</a> <a href=https://icfo.eu>continents</a> 🌏🌎🌍</p><p>On that note, I love to travel and explore the world and nature. I also enjoy movies, books, cards & board games, beer, hanging out with friends and family, our pets, gardening, writing and cooking. When I was younger I spent a lot of time gaming, where I first learned the value of a hexeditor. (Of course, when I <em>started</em> playing computer games as a young child, you had to either type the program into the console in BASIC, or wait for the game to load&mldr; <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC_464>from an audio cassette</a>!)</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
